    Select this option to run tests in parallel across labelled nodes.  
    Nodes need to have a Windows OS with useMango installed.
    <br/><br/>
    If this option is not selected or the Label Expression is empty, tests will be executed on the Jenkins master node only.  
    This assumes the master has a Windows OS with useMango installed.
    <br/><br/>
    Tip: For running useMango tests, we recommend adding the label 'usemango' to all your useMango Windows slave nodes.
